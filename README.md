# langgraph_001
**My First Few LangGraph Programs**

---

## Overview
This is a basic demo of how **LangGraph** works.
It starts with simple graph logic and gradually progresses to more advanced features, including the creation of **chatbots** and **basic AI agents** using the *Gemini AI API*.

## Why I Chose Gemini

- ✅ It’s free to start with
- ✅ Highly scalable
- ✅ Google’s AI models are powerful and affordable for enterprise use
- ✅ Integrates smoothly with LangGraph

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   Using GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   gh repo clone whoshnri/langgraph_001
   ```

2. **Create a virtual env to run python and install dependencies**
    use:
        `python -m venv venv`
    activate it:
            `source venv/bin/activate`
3. **Install the requirements from the 'req.txt' file**
    use :
        `pip install -r req.txt`

4. **Run the chatbot in the 'ai_agents1.py' file**
    use:
        `python ai_agents1.py`







### next steps
I aim to do more with langgraph, some of my aims are,

- [x] Create basic ai chatbot
- [ ] Create an ai chatbot that can format data in json or csv and run on my website
- [ ] Create a multimodal bot, someday
- [ ] Optimize the chatbot for more complex roles and more detailed answering methodology (*was my grammer corect?*)
